####1. Personality/Self-introduction
* Self-introduction
    - Q: Please introduce yourself briefly(So tell me yourself.).
    - A: My name is Bryan.  
         I'm from China and I was born in Beijing.   
         I'm Chinese and I'm 40 years old now.  
         I live in Beijing now and I spent most of my life here.     
         Till now, I have graduated from BUAA(Beihang) University for 3 years and my major is Computer Science and Technology.  
         Now I'm a programmer at an entrepreneurial firm.  
         Since graduation, I have had over 15 years of work experience.   
         My hobbies are very extensive. I like sports, music, movies, games, and reading.     
         I enjoy playing basketball with others very much, so I am playing it continually for 20 years and I believe I'm good at it.        
    - Q: How many people are there in your family?
    - A: My family is not large.  
         There are three people in my family now, my mother, my father and I.  
         I have a very good relationship with my mother, but I have a very bad relationship with my father because I think he is the man who is not only foolish but means as well.  

* Character
    - Q: What do you think of your personality? Are you an outgoing or introvert man?
    - A: I think I'm a cheerful person. I will never give up.  
         Once I'm an introverted person. I'm not good at social communications.  
         So I think I should join in more activities and make more friends.
         I feel I'm neither an outgoing nor introvert man, for sometimes I would be very outgoing and talkative when I'm spending time with my acquaintances, but sometimes I don't talk much with strangers especially with a girl.
