Who does Grant want to invite to the party?
I want to invite my friend Jim to the party, too.
He is handsome and nice.
I don't want you to date him.
I just want you to meet him.
I met a different Emily.
She has beautiful blue eyes.
Maybe she wore blue contact lenses.

Where's my dinner?
Here you go.
Where's my newspaper?
Here you go.
Can I have some cake?
Here you go.

I think I know her.
You really want to meet her, don't you?
I hope you date a really nice girl.
The sky looks gray.
There's something wrong with his eyes.
He can't see well. 
What's your favorite color?
My favorite color is blue.
