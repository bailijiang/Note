# P1 Happy New Year
* How did you celebrate the New Year?
* I went to a friend's party.
  I went to City Park with friends.
  We went to a wedding.
* What is your favorite part of the New Year?
  Fireworks are my favorite part.
* Alex is a little nervous.
* You look nervous. Don't be!
  You look worried. Don't be!
  You look angry. Don't be!
* How was your New Year's?
  How was your weekend?
  How was school?
* It was good.
  It was bad.
  My New Year's was great.
* Now I want you to change and forth and go as fast as you can for ten seconds.
