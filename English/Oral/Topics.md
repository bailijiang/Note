    at, for, sometimes, usually, often

After getting up, I often go to the park jogging for half an hour, and then I have to go to the office.
Usually, I get there driving by myself, but in the rush hour, I will take the subway to avoid traffic jam.
If I drive myself, it'll cost 20 yuan for gas, and if I take the subway, it'll cost 7 yuan for commuting every day.
When arriving at the office, I have to punch in on time.
And then I have to take part in a regular meeting with our team.
After that, I have to write the code of the program for our new project.
I expect to have lunch at 12 o'clock, but if the people in the canteen are very crowded at that time, I prefer to have lunch at 1 o'clock.
I expect to go home at 6, but on Friday, I sometimes prefer to go home later.
After work, when I get home, I like listening to music for a while, and sometimes I would like to play PCs games such as StarCraft, PUBG, etc.
Before I go to bed, I'm used to reading a book for an hour.

I'm a Gemini, and I'm a dynamic person.
According to my horoscope, I should be mercurial, sensitive, childish, curious, humorous, and dual personality.
But I don't read my horoscope every day.
Because to some extent, I think this is a kind of superstitious, and human being's character traits are not that simple. It is just an entertaining manner.
In terms of my life, I won't like anybody or anything easily.
But once if I like somebody through thoroughly understanding, I won't change easily too.
So I'm not a mercurial person.
I think I'm sensitive, curious, and humorous, but definitely not childish.
And I think sometimes I'm a pessimist.
At least I'm not an optimist.
One of my best friends, Claire, she is a Cancer.
And according to her horoscope, she should be harmony, responsible, single-minded, integrity, and creativity.
I think she matches a few traits of those, such as responsible and integrity, but in general, it's not accurate, even is totally opposite.

    privacy, freedom, family involved
    the famous show host
    actor, professor, journalist
    the truth, justice, reveal
    real intention, easy to believe
    be taken advantage of by bad people
    to protect themselves


It's nice to be famous because you will be rich or maybe you can appear on TV or you will have lots of fans.
On the other hand, as a celebrity, you will lose your privacy and your freedom is limited and even your family will be involved.
Usually, celebrities would appear in politics, sports, culture, and entertainment.
I like a person who used to be a famous show host.
His name is Cui Yong Yuan.
He used to be a journalist, actor, and professor of the university.
I admire him because I think he is a person who is integrity and he always tells the truth about our society.
I feel he has a good overall sense of justice and fairness.
He managed to reveal the problem of actors' tax evasion.
Indeed, he may have some convenience than other people, 
but meanwhile, he is also hurt easier than ordinary people.
In a movie, as an actor, he used to be taken advantage of by the director to make money and this movie hurt his reputation deeply.
So if I were him, I wouldn't have believed anybody easily.
Unless I know his real intension.
Because only in this way I can protect my self and my family.

    It's hard to...

I've moved house five times.
The last time I moved house, I went from a small place to a bigger place.
This time made me felt very tedious and exhausted, it just likes a nightmare!
I moved something that small like clothes, computers, necessities by myself, but I had something big moved by a moving company such as furniture and sofa because they are too heavy to carry.
During the process of moving house, some little things are a problem, too.
Little things break so easily, even if you move them carefully.
The worst thing about moving house for me was when I moved the bed into my bedroom slowly and carefully, I found it's hard to fit it into the new place.
So I had to buy a new bed and assemble it by myself.
You know, it has almost 50 screws and 20 parts.
It took me two whole days to finish it.
