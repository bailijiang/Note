####1. Personality/Self-introduction
* Self-introduction
    - Q: Please introduce yourself briefly(So tell me yourself.).
    - A: My name is Bryan.  
         I'm from China and I was born in Beijing.   
         I'm Chinese and I'm 40 years old now.  
         I live in Beijing now and I spent most of my life here.     
         Till now, I have graduated from BUAA(Beihang) University for 3 years and my major is Computer Science and Technology.  
         Now I'm a programmer at an entrepreneurial firm.  
         Since graduation, I have had over 15 years of work experience.   
         My hobbies are very extensive. I like sports, music, movies, games, and reading.     
         I enjoy playing basketball with others very much, so I am playing it continually for 20 years and I believe I'm good at it.        

    - Q: How many people are there in your family?
    - A: My family is not large.  
         There are three people in my family now, my mother, my father and I.  
         I have a very good relationship with my mother, but I have a very bad relationship with my father because I think he is the man who is not only foolish but means as well.  

* Character
    - Q: What's your personality like? Are you an outgoing or introvert man?
    - A: I think I'm a cheerful person. I will never give up.  
         Once I'm an introverted person. I'm not good at social communications.  
         So I think I should join in more activities and make more friends.
         I feel I'm neither an outgoing nor introvert man, for sometimes I would be very outgoing and talkative when I'm spending time with my acquaintances, but sometimes I don't talk much with strangers especially with a girl.   

    - Q: What kind of person do you think you are?    
    - A: I think I'm a kindness man because I am always loving to play with small animals like rabbits or kitten since my childhood.  
         And I feel sometimes I am so naive that I believe all of the people of the world are good.  
         I rarely have the guard against the others, so I always have been deceived by others in many ways.    
         I think I'm a definitely sincere person and I hated the people of hypocrisy totally.  
         And I also think I'm a brave man, for I always choose the right one over the easy one when I'm in trouble.  
         However(Of course), I also have some shortcomings: For example, When I suffer a setback I'm so irritable that it at times leads to bad results, and When I'm in the complex situations I sometimes would ignore the point of the things.  
         I think I used to be a perfectionist, but now I'm not the one.   

    - Q: How do you get along with others in your life? I wonder what you care or don't care about in your life?
    - A: As far as my concerned, most people in this country whom I don't like to make contact with.  
         In most cases, I neither trust nor respect anyone and I don't care anyone how they judge me.  
         But I think I am a person who values emotion.  
         I believe the emotion of a person is far more important than money in any case forever.  
         Although my friends are not too much, they are all kindness, honesty, and value emotion.  
         And what is more, they must have a craft of their living and they can't be fools.  
         Furthermore, they would not cheat the good person even if they can do it, and at the same time, they also would not be cheated by the bad guys easily.  

    - Q: Are you a strict person? Do you set high-demand for yourself?
