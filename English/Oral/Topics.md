After getting up, I often go to the park jogging for half an hour, and then I have to go to the office.
Usually, I get there driving by myself, but in the rush hour, I will take the subway to avoid traffic jam.
If I drive myself, it'll cost 20 yuan for gas, and if I take the subway, it'll cost 7 yuan for commuting every day.
When arriving at the office, I have to punch in on time.
And then I have to take part in a regular meeting with our team.
After that, I have to write the code of the program for our new project.
I expect to have lunch at 12 o'clock, but if the people in the canteen are very crowded at that time, I prefer to have lunch at 1 o'clock.
I expect to go home at 6, but on Friday, I sometimes prefer to go home later.
After work, when I get home, I like listening to music for a while, and sometimes I would like to play PCs games such as StarCraft, PUBG, etc.
Before I go to bed, I'm used to reading a book for an hour.

I'm a Gemini, and I'm a dynamic person.
According to my horoscope, I should be mercurial, sensitive, childish, curious, humorous, and dual personality.
But I don't read my horoscope every day.
Because to some extent, I think this is a kind of superstitious, and human being's character traits are not that simple. It is just an entertaining manner.
In terms of my life, I won't like anybody or anything easily.
But once if I like somebody through thoroughly understanding, I won't change easily too.
So I'm not a mercurial person.
I think I'm sensitive, curious, and humorous, but definitely not childish.
And I think sometimes I'm a pessimist.
At least I'm not an optimist.
One of my best friends, Claire, she is a Cancer.
And according to her horoscope, she should be harmony, responsible, single-minded, integrity, and creativity.
I think she matches a few traits of those, such as responsible and integrity, but in general, it's not accurate, even is totally opposite.


## 3. Talking about being famous
* What kind of people are generally famous and always in the public eye?
* What is one of the good things about being famous?
* What is one of the bad things?

keywords:
    famous--rich--appear--fans
    privacy--freedom--involve--appear in
    a famous show host--Cui Yong Yuan
    journalist--actor--professor
    admire--tells truth--justice
    reveal--tax evasion
    convenience--hurt
    movie--his reputation
    not believe--intension--protect

It's nice to be famous because you will be rich or maybe you can appear on TV or you will have lots of fans.
On the other hand, as a celebrity, you will lose your privacy and your freedom is limited and even your family will be involved.
Usually, celebrities would appear in politics, sports, culture, and entertainment.
I like a person who used to be a famous show host.
His name is Cui Yong Yuan.
He used to be a journalist, actor, and professor of the university.
I admire him because I think he is a person who is integrity and he always tells the truth about our society.
I feel he has a good overall sense of justice and fairness.
He managed to reveal the problem of actors' tax evasion.
Indeed, he may have some convenience than other people, 
but meanwhile, he is also hurt easier than ordinary people.
In a movie, as an actor, he used to be taken advantage of by the director to make money and this movie hurt his reputation deeply.
So if I were him, I wouldn't have believed anybody easily.
Unless I know his real intension.
Because only in this way I can protect my self and my family.

    worst thing--bed--hard to fit

I've moved house five times.
The last time I moved house, I went from a small place to a bigger place.
This time made me felt very tedious and exhausted, it just likes a nightmare!
I moved something that small like clothes, computers, necessities by myself, but I had something big moved by a moving company such as furniture and sofa because they are too heavy to carry.
During the process of moving house, some little things are a problem, too.
Little things break so easily, even if you move them carefully.
The worst thing about moving house for me was when I moved the bed into my bedroom slowly and carefully, I found it's hard to fit it into the new place.
So I had to buy a new bed and assemble it by myself.
You know, it has almost 50 screws and 20 parts.
It took me two whole days to finish it.


## 5. Talking about breaking up

I first met Alice when I was 27. We have broken up for five years.
We had dated for two years before broke up.
I made the first move to break up because I think we are not compatible.
The main reason I guess is that she did not really love me.
She just loved some material conditions about me, such as house, car, money, etc.
Lastly, I even felt she is a gold-digger, she always compared me to other people and wanted to make me change a lot of things.
During that time, I tolerated all her pickiness and I felt so painful.
She hurt my heart so deeply.
So I had to break up with her at last.
Since then I haven't met any other girlfriend until now.
Through that experience, I've learned how to recognize the nature of a person.
I think we should all understand each other completely before dating.
After that, I never contact with Alice again.


## 6. Talking about teenagers from their parents
* What kinds of things do parents have to buy for their children?
* What kinds of things are less necessary?
* How much spending money should teenagers have? Why?
* Why is life sometimes difficult for teenagers?
* Do teenagers expect too much from their parents? Why?

keywords:
    money, pocket money, luxury brand
    compare each other, dispise
    majority, minority, useful person

Teenagers generally expect a lot from their parents.
Parents have to buy something that they are related to study for their children.
But these days, most teenagers have a mobile phone, a laptop, even a car.
Indeed, nowadays, money is above morals, culture, education, and politics.
So teenagers are too easy to compare each other everywhere.
They always want to buy luxury brand clothes, such as Nike, Adidas.
Because if they buy some cheaper clothes or other things, they will be despised by their classmates.
I think the average of teenagers' pocket money must be over 1,000 yuan a month and in some private high school, it may have been over 3,000 yuan.
The majority expect more money from their parents, only the minority expect to learn how to be a useful person.

* What did you think of your teachers?

keywords:
    integrity, honesty, chose right, learn

    same kind
    teacher--irresponsible
    self-study

The person I admire most is Bryan. He is my colleague. 
I admire him because he is honesty, integrity, and kind.
And whenever he faces the choice, he always chooses the right one, not the easy one.
The person I admire least is Ethan. He always lies to everybody and he never learns.
There are only a few people who admire me and I think they are the same kind of person as mine.
There are lots of people who don't admire me and I think they may have been the same kind of person as Ethan.
During high school, my school report cards are not good. I really don't like this kind of education's manner.
I don't like my teachers, I think most of them are irresponsible for their jobs.
Until now, the knowledge that I've learned is totally by self-study.
