How do I know if a test is needed until after I run it?

He told me, in the nicest possible way, that I was interfering too much.

I'm sorry to bother you, but can you direct me to the nearest metro station?

The pros and cons cancle out.

Nothing can compensate for the loss of time.

People whose neighbours have pets always claim that their sleep is interrupted at midnight by pets' noises.

I have been going ahead defying all difficulties.

Job transmission is still viewed as one of the keys to fulfil the higher goal in the professional path.

Maybe I can't make it perfect, but I can try.

I'm new here and would appreciate your guidance.
Please teach me more.
