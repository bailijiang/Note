####Character
* Q: What's your personality like? Are you an outgoing or introvert man? What are you like as a person?
* A: I think I'm a cheerful person. I will never give up.  
     Once I'm an introverted person. I'm not good at social communications.    
     So I think I should join in more activities and make more friends.  
     I feel I'm neither an outgoing nor introvert man, for sometimes I would be very outgoing and talkative when I'm spending time with my acquaintances, but sometimes I don't talk much with strangers especially with a girl.   

* Q: What kind of person do you think you are?    
* A: I think I'm a kindness man because I am always loving to play with small animals like rabbits or kitten since my childhood.  
     And I feel sometimes I am so naive that I believe all of the people of the world are good.  
     I rarely have the guard against the others, so I always have been deceived by others in many ways.    
     I think I'm a definitely sincere person and I hated the people of hypocrisy totally.  
     And I also think I'm a brave man, for I always choose the right one over the easy one when I'm in trouble.  
     However(Of course), I also have some shortcomings: For example, When I suffer a setback I'm so irritable that it at times leads to bad results, and When I'm in the complex situations I sometimes would ignore the point of the things.  
     I think I used to be a perfectionist, but now I'm not the one.   

* Q: How do you get along with others in your life? I wonder what you care or don't care about in your life?
* A: As far as my concerned, most people in this country whom I don't like to make contact with.  
     In most cases, Neither do I trust nor respect anyone and meanwhile I don't care anybody how they judge me.  
     But I think I am a person who values emotion.  
     I believe the emotion of a person is far more important than money in any case forever.  
     Although my friends are not too much, they are all kindness, honesty, and value emotion.  
     And what is more, they must have a craft of their living and they can't be fools.  
     Furthermore, they would not cheat the good person even if they can do it, and at the same time, they also would not be cheated by the bad guys easily.  

* Q: Are you a strict person? Whether you set high-demand for yourself?
* A: In general, I have been leading an orderly life for myself.  
     In terms of life:  
     I'm used to getting up early at 6:00 am and going to bed at 10:00 pm every day.  
     I usually drink a glass of milk and have an egg, an apple every day and I almost have green tea in the morning.  
     I stick to exercise every day.  
     I play basketball one or two times every week.   
     If I hadn't gone to play basketball, I would have taken a walk five miles after dinner.  
     Occasionally I would go swimming or play table tennis as well.  
     Meanwhile, I never drinking and smoking.  
     In terms of learning:  
     I would make an overall plan of learning every year and would also make a specific plan each month.  
     The learning plan includes computer technology, English, or other hobbies like music.  
     In the learning progressing, Whenever I got a difficult problem, I will keep trying constantly until finding a solution.  
     In terms of working:  
     I always take my work seriously and responsibly, and I never hide my mistakes.

####Experience,Story
* Q: Have you ever had a pet in your childhood?  
* A: I have ever had many pets in my childhood, such as dogs, cats, rabbits, parrots, fish, tortoise, and bats, etc, but the most impressive me of them is one rabbit.  
     When I was 6 years old, someone gave me a little bunny and I am so happy with it.  
     I made a rabbit nest using a basket and put it at the balcony in my home.  
     During that time, the rabbit had had a very good time and she was growing up quickly.  
     I used to feed it all kinds of vegetables and carrots and even some sausages.  
     Occasionally I also take it to play outside with me, but my rabbit was so timid that she always unwilling to stay away from me.  
     My rabbit so loves to clean itself because it would wash its own face every day, and I found it so cute.  
     Till now, I still remember that my rabbit was very sensible and polite.  
     Whenever I opened the door of the balcony she never entered the room itself and just looked at me.  
     But then one day, my rabbit died somehow.  
     I saw it had its head stuck in the basket and didn't move anymore.  
     At that moment I felt so sad.  
     Finally, I buried it and set a gravestone for it.  

* Q: What was your most impressive trip or business trip?  
* A: Though I haven't been to many places, Jiuquan, Gansu province is one of the most impressive places since then I have ever been a trip.  
     That trip was a business trip and there was only one colleague came with me.  
     At that time we were going to the place which was an Airforce base where located at an extreme distance plot covered by the Gobi desert for 200 kilometers.  
     As that the business trip was hurried, we didn't get the sleeper tickets.  
     So we had to stand invariably through the whole journey for 33 hours and the train was extremely crowded.  
     After arriving at the Airforce base, we immediately go to work to install the equipment for the project during which we met a lot of difficulties like no tools, no network, the line was not long enough, etc.  
     Later we had finally managed to overcome all the difficulties and had finished the project in a week.   
     I remember the most agreeable moment during that time was every night when I sat outside and looked at the sky.  
     The night sky of that place was full of twinkling stars and as there was no one tall building at all, it seemed like the sky and the earth was connected and I could touch those stars.   
     That beautiful scenery has never can be seen in the city.  
     The other exciting part was the flight we were taking when we returned, which was a military aircraft, its totally different from a normal plane.  
     There was not only the speed of the military aircraft but its raising speed and turning speed much faster than the normal plane.  
     The feeling of that flight was over 100 times insane than a roller coaster.  

* Q: Have you ever met a girl who set your heart racing?(fall in love)  
* A: I have ever met a girl when I was 24 years old and she was my colleague.  
     I felt she is so beautiful and adorable that my heart racing when I saw her every time.  
     I remember that our first met was at a quiz compete which was held by our company.  
     She and I were happened to be assigned in a same team.  
     In the competition, we had cooperated with each other very well and had won the third at last.  
     After a while, she had been transferred to our department and we were starting to work together.  
     During that time, I was feeling so happy because I could see her every day.  
     We were almost talking about anything.  
     After work, we were still together went shopping, had dinner or sometimes went to sing songs and play games.  
     I'm so missing those good times.  

* Q: Do you think which is the best English textbook have you ever read? Why?  
* A: I have read a lot of English textbooks and I think the New Concept English series is the most classical among these.    
     I have already learned the New Concept English book one, book two and book three many times.  
     The main content of the NCE1 is basic oral English, and the NCE2 includes basic English Grammar, and the NCE3 contains comprehensive reading and practicing.  
     I haven't read NCE4 and If I should have time later I would read it probably.  
     Many people thought NCE1 and NCE2 were too easy to learn.  
     On the contrary, I think these two books are very important and they are the foundation for learning NCE3 well.  
     I find it that the most classical characteristic of the NCE series is not only can systematically but gradually learn its knowledge.  
     The author of the NCE, L.G.Alexander had said that the key point of learning English well was read and read again.  
     Every time I learned NCE, that it always let me improve to a certain extent in English.  
    
* Q: Can you tell me what is your favorite food? And if you can cook it for yourself you can tell me how you cook it?
     Oh, this cake looks very delicious, how did you cook it?
* A: Actually, I like many kinds of food such as chicken, beef, and shrimp, and what is more, I also like to cook them for myself, but recently I am practicing baking the cake in an oven at home. Now I've known it's not easy to make a nice taste and a nice-looking cake.  
     This recipe is for two.  
     First of all, you must prepare all the ingredients for the cake. They include four eggs, 120 grams of cake flour, 80g sugar, and 50g milk. And you must have an oven, a cake mold, and an egg beater. Following we can start cooking the cake.  
     Practices(Directions):  
     (1). Separate the whites from the yolk of the eggs and put them in two larger containers;  
     (2). Using the egg beater with middle speed and stirring the whites of the eggs until it becomes dry foaming, during which this process the sugar must be added in 3 times;  
     (3). In the yolk container,  you need to pour the milk in it and mix them well, and then pour the cake flour in it and mix them well yet;  
     (4). Put the foaming of the whites into the yolk container, and mix them well in the same way;  
     (5). Pour the batter into the cake mold;  
     (6). Bring the cake mold into the oven and set 165 degrees Celsius, 40 minutes and then start it;  
     (7). No sooner you take the cake mold out of the oven than you must put them up and down;  
     (8). After 10 minutes you can turn the mold up and take the cake out of it;  

* Q: Have you ever experienced any dangerous moments?
* A: I have experienced one horrible scene even now I think of it with horror.
     As I was 10 years old, one day I explored outside with my little friends.
     We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep ditch. We could see on the other side of the ditch, there was a large prosperous orchard. But the ditch was many yards long and was five meters wide and at least six meters deep. So if we wanted to arrive that orchard, we must across the ditch. We need to climb down the ditch first and then climb up on the other side. On the beginning, I started climbing it went very well, but when I almost climbed up the other side, I suddenly slipped with my back down the bottom of the ditch. I remembered when I fall to the bottom of the ditch I immediately lost consciousness. After ten minutes, I had just woke up slowly. I was startled to find a heap of stones on my left, a stack of iron bars on my right, and I had happened to fall on a piece of straw mattress. I felt so lucky at that time. Afterwards, there was a boy jumped down the ditch at the same spot, but he broke his arm.

* Q: I want to know which country do you like?
* A: I like America because its legal system is relatively perfect. 
I don't like China because it has no credit system and serious air pollution.
But I prefer Norway to the USA because it's a coastal forest country and not only people's average income high but the gap between rich and poor is small.
